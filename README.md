# Reason to exist
Hi! 👋 the idea of this project came to me after seeing how my downloads folder was structured, and by structured i mean being a complete mess.

This is the first time i make a project of this kind so there could be a lot of errors (if you come across one or have a contributions please let me know).

# How to install
This is the easiest way i could find to share the script but if somebody knows a better way please let me know 🙏.

1) Download the zip from the code button.

2) Go inside the dist folder.

3) Go inside the sort_downloads folder and copy the content.

4) Press WINDOWS + R and type shell:startup to open the startup folder.

5) Paste it inside said folder.

6) Go inside the folder called internal and:
    + click properties
    + check hidden


The last step exist so the internal folder doesn't open after the script ends his execution.

and that's all! Hope the project is useful, maybe in the future i'll improve it or add some more functionalities like the posiibility to select a path or something like that.
